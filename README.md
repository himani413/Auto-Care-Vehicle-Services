# Auto Care Vehicle Services🚘

Welcome to Auto Care Vehicle Services, a secure and efficient web application designed to streamline vehicle service reservations and management. 

This dynamic web app not only simplifies the reservation process but also prioritizes security by addressing OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Additionally, the user authentication and access control have been implemented using <i>OIDC protocols<i> with a cloud-based Identity Provider (IDP) Asgardeo. Various techniques were employed to ensure the security of this application, from safeguarding against <i>Broken Access Control</i> to mitigating <i>Injection Vulnerabilities</i> and addressing <i>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</i> threats. Explore this repository to learn how to fortify your web applications against these common vulnerabilities and enhance your understanding of web application security.
